<p>I always have an exciting and challenging project in the works. Aside from some ios/android and PWA based projects, I am working on a fun API. I love dawn of war quotes and one of my current favorite projects is building an API that uses most of the known, and some of the unknown works around warhammer 40k to generate quotes.</p>
